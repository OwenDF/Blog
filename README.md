My blog where I write about things I have found interesting.

### Deployment:
![Deploy to GihHub Pages](https://github.com/benchiverton/Blog/workflows/Deploy%20to%20GitHub%20Pages/badge.svg)

The app is deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions whenever new code is pushed, following the instructions [here](https://www.davideguida.com/how-to-deploy-blazor-webassembly-on-github-pages-using-github-actions/). The latest deployment can be found here: https://benchiverton.github.io/Blog

There are some issues as GitHub Pages wasn't designed to support this type of deployment, but it's mostly fine.
